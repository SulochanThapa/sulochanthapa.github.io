                            and can be grown in cooler climates like Darjeeling and Sikkim. They require moderate light and humidity, making them 
                            suitable for homes with controlled environments.

                <div class="space-y-6">
                    <!-- Proper Light Conditions -->

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">Proper Light Conditions</h3>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                            While orchids love bright light, they should be shielded from direct sunlight, as it can scorch their delicate leaves. 
                            A well-lit room with indirect sunlight is ideal for indoor orchids, while outdoor orchids should be planted in shaded 
                            or partially shaded areas.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">Humidity and Temperature</h3>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                            Orchids thrive in environments with high humidity, typically between 40-60%. Make sure to keep your orchids in a humid 
                            environment, especially during dry seasons. If growing indoors, you can use a humidity tray or mist the plants with 
                            water to maintain optimal moisture levels.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                            Overwatering is a common mistake when it comes to orchids. Make sure your orchids have good drainage to avoid waterlogging, 
                            which can lead to root rot. Water your orchids once a week, and allow the soil to dry out between waterings.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                            Feed your orchids with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer once every two weeks during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilizing, 
                            as it can damage the roots.
