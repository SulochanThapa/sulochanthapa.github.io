<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Let's dive into some specific ways <strong>agricultural innovation</strong> is tackling climate change, and why these developments matter for your local business.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 animate-fadeIn">Drought-Resistant and Salinity-Tolerant Crops</h3>
<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Water scarcity is a global crisis, and agriculture accounts for a massive portion of freshwater usage. Biotechnology is enabling the development of crop varieties that can withstand prolonged periods of drought or grow in soils with high salt content (salinity), which often results from changing rainfall patterns and sea-level rise.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
<li>  <strong>Impact on Local Businesses:</strong> Farms using these crops can maintain consistent yields even in adverse conditions, stabilizing prices for local restaurants, grocery stores, and food processors. It reduces the risk of crop failure and ensures a more reliable <strong>local food system</strong>.</li>
</ul>
